## 🚀 One-Command Setup

For new developers, just run:

```bash
make setup
```

This single command will:
- ✅ Check all prerequisites are installed
- 📝 Set up environment files from templates
- 📦 Install Python and Node.js dependencies
- 🚀 Start the development environment
- 🎉 Show you all the URLs to access your app

## 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - For containerized development
- **uv** - Python package manager ([install guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))
- **Node.js** - For the React frontend

## 🔧 Full Setup (Recommended)

For a complete setup with secure secrets:

```bash
make setup-full
```

This includes everything from `make setup` plus:
- 🔐 Generates secure secrets for your `.env` file
- 🗄️ Runs database migrations

## ⚡ Development URLs

Once setup is complete, access your app at:

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
